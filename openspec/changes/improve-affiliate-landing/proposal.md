# Proposal: Improve Affiliate Landing Page

## Summary
Enhance the affiliate landing page (`/affiliate`) for non-members and non-logged-in users with comprehensive program information, benefits, and visual elements.

## Problem
Currently, when a user visits `/affiliate` without being registered:
- Only shows: "Join the Affiliate Program"
- One line of text: "Earn up to 25% commission on trading fees"
- Single "Become an Affiliate" button

This is insufficient to:
1. Explain how the commission system works
2. Show the tier structure and earning potential
3. Demonstrate the 5-generation deep earning (Zero Line)
4. Explain Team Differential (Sun Line) bonuses
5. Motivate users to join

## Proposed Solution
Create a rich landing page with multiple sections:

1. **Hero Section** - Eye-catching headline with key value prop
2. **Benefits Grid** - 3-4 key benefits with icons
3. **How It Works** - Simple 3-step explanation
4. **Commission Structure** - Visual tier table
5. **Income Calculator** - Interactive earnings preview
6. **CTA Section** - Final call-to-action with button

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Frontend UI enhancement only
- **Out of Scope**: Backend changes, new API endpoints
