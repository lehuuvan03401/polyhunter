            "q2": "Can I copy multiple traders at once?",
            "a2": "Yes! With Horus, you can copy unlimited traders simultaneously. This is actually recommended for diversification — if one trader has a bad week, others may balance it out.",
            "q3": "How much should I allocate per trader?",
            "a3": "We recommend starting with $50-100 per trader and spreading across 3-5 traders. As you learn which traders perform best for your risk tolerance, you can adjust allocations.",
            "q4": "What if a top trader starts losing money?",
            "a4": "You can pause or stop copying any trader instantly. We recommend checking your portfolio weekly and adjusting if a trader has lost more than 20% in a month.",
            "q5": "Are these traders verified?",
            "a5": "All trader statistics on Horus come directly from on-chain Polymarket data. Win rates, PnL, and trading history are verifiable and cannot be faked."
